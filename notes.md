## Naming Conventions
* camel case: if word contains more than one word, then first letter of first word is small, first letter of remaining words should be capital. Example: FirstName. Camel Case: firstName
* spinal case: first-name
* upper/properr case: FirstName
* all upper case: FIRSTNAME

### Java naming conventions
* all class names, interface names, enum names -> upper case
* variable names, object reference names, method names, arguments, parameters -> camel case
* enum values, constants -> all caps
* package names -> all small. each word seperated with other word by dot
